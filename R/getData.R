#' Get official data about Covid-19 cases in Mexico
#'
#' Get official data about Covid-19 cases in Mexico. Main data source is Mexico's
#' Federal Government Ministry of Health (Secretar√≠a de Salud). It should be noted, however,
#' that the open data format of the daily report is generated by third parties, since the original
#' report is a PDF document.
#'
#' @return A `tibble` with 8 columns:
#' Case Number, State, Sex, Age, Symptoms Onset Date, COVID-19 Test Result, Country Visited,
#' Date of Arrival to Mexico
#'
#' @param type Get `confirmed` or `suspect` cases?. `character` vector of length 1.
#' @param date Date (version) of the published results. `character` vector of length 1 or `date` object.
#' @param source Data source. Mexico's Ministry of Health publishes a daily report containing data about
#' positive and suspected cases of Covid-19 cases in the country.
#' However, the data is published as a PDF document, difficulting further analysis.
#' This package relies on third party sources to get an "open data" version of the report.
#' `character` vector of length 1. Possible data sources are: `Serendipia`.
