Get Covid-19 Data From Katia Guzman's GitHub repo
}
\details{
Mexico's Ministry of Health publishes a daily report containing data about
positive and suspected cases of Covid-19 cases in the country (Comunicado TÃ©cnico Diario). However, this report is published
as a PDF document, difficulting further analysis. Katia Guzman makes an open format
version of the report that it's also manually checked for errors and includes a column
with the date when the case was first registered in the official count.

**WARNING: Data from \code{Guzmart} repository stopped daily updates on 06/04/2020. In future versions of this package, this source will be removed.**
